        "text": "Pratya Anvesh Chinta has worked with me for almost two years, and during that time, he has literally been a god send. His first semester working with me was during the aftermath of my extensive surgery, which made it difficult for me to do more than the minimum expected of me. However, I was able to not only make it through the semester, but excel because I had Anvesh to help me. He personally worked with the hundreds of students in my classes, and made sure they were up to date in attendance and grades. I never thought he could possibly do more than he did that first semester, but when the university shut down due to the Corona virus, it was Anvesh and his knowledge of technology that kept me and the class going. He ensured that videos and other materials were made available to the students, and his knowledge helped me successfully navigate a most difficult circumstance. In the fall of 2020, he again proved his value when half of my classes opted to take my classes face-to-face, while the other half opted to take the class virtually. He has successfully worked with all of my students to keep them on track to ensure their success. Time and time again, Anvesh has risen to whatever challenge has arisen. He is knowledgeable, patient, loyal, kind and caring, and any company who hires him is certain to get a valuable asset, one I am mortified to lose.",

Lots has been thrown at him since he arrived, many new technologies and a lot about our business. He’s taking the time to understand all of it. He is very inquisitive, always wanting to learn all that he can, not just about his immediate task but he looks broader. I can tell he is a fast learner and applying what he has learned in school so far. I wish we were all back in the office together as that would give Pratya an even better experience, but I can safely say that he’s making the best of the situation for sure. I expect at the end of the summer that we’ll have many fully functional tests for our automation which will be a huge value add and he will have learned a lot about our applications, automation, our team and our company.
